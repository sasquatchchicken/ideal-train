Malicious_PowerShell_Payload

# Repository Overview

This repository demonstrates a potential nefarious payload delivery system leveraging a BadUSB attack (DuckyScript) to disable security defenses and establish a reverse shell. It walks through how an attacker could craft and deploy malicious payloads using PowerShell and obfuscation techniques. The repo includes DuckyScript, obfuscated PowerShell reverse shell, and a PowerShell script that connects back to a Command & Control (C2) server.

# Files Included:
1. **badusb_rvShell_obfuscated.txt:** A DuckyScript that opens the Windows Security settings, disables real-time protection, and launches PowerShell to run an obfuscated reverse shell payload from a remote server.
   
2. **RVShell_obfuscated.ps1:** An obfuscated reverse shell that connects to a C2 server over a TCP connection.
   
3. **execute_RVShell1.ps1:** A PowerShell script that downloads and executes a payload from a server, providing the attacker a reverse shell on the target machine.

# Malicious PowerShell Payload Delivery via BadUSB
This repository demonstrates a potential attack chain leveraging PowerShell and BadUSB (DuckyScript) to disable security defenses and establish a reverse shell back to a remote server. The repository includes various components that can be used to launch such an attack, including obfuscated payloads, PowerShell reverse shell scripts, and a DuckyScript that automates disabling Windows Defender.

## Repository Contents:
1. **badusb_rvShell_obfuscated.txt:**

**Purpose:** This script demonstrates how a BadUSB device (like a flipperZero) could be used to disable Windows Defender and launch a malicious PowerShell script from a remote server.

**Details:** The script opens the Run dialog, navigates the Windows Security settings to disable Real-Time Protection, and then launches a reverse shell via PowerShell.

2. **RVShell_obfuscated.ps1:**

**Purpose:** This PowerShell script is obfuscated and designed to connect to a remote Command & Control (C2) server, establish a reverse shell, and execute commands on the compromised machine.

**Details:** The payload is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime to evade detection by security tools.

3. **execute_RVShell1.ps1:**

**Purpose:** This PowerShell script downloads and executes the payload from the attacker's server, creating a reverse shell to establish control over the target machine.

**Details:** This is the final payload that establishes a remote connection.
 
# Potential Implications of this Attack
**This attack chain poses serious implications for system and network security:**

**Security Bypass:** By disabling Windows Defender and using an obfuscated payload, this attack can evade basic antivirus protection and establish a foothold on the system.

**Reverse Shell Access:** Once the payload executes, it opens a reverse shell that allows an attacker to remotely execute commands, manipulate files, install additional malware, or move laterally within the network.

**Obfuscation Techniques:** By obfuscating the payload (e.g., using base64 encoding), the attack becomes more difficult to detect by traditional signature-based defenses.

**USB Vector:** The use of a BadUSB device as the delivery mechanism increases the likelihood of success, as it can simulate trusted input (keyboard) and execute commands without requiring user interaction.

# Conclusion
This repository serves as an example of how BadUSB attacks combined with PowerShell obfuscation can be used to bypass basic security mechanisms and establish a remote foothold in a system. This demonstrates the importance of layered security and advanced protection techniques against modern attack vectors.
